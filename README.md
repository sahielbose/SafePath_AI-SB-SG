Suicide detection is a critical challenge in mental health analytics, and this project aims to provide a data-driven approach using Linear Regression. By analyzing key behavioral, social, and psychological factors, the model predicts the likelihood of suicide risk in teenagers. Built with Python and leveraging machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, this project offers an interpretable solution for early intervention strategies.

The dataset undergoes rigorous preprocessing, including feature selection, missing value handling, and normalization, to ensure optimal performance. The core model is based on Linear Regression, which identifies patterns in the data and provides probability estimates for at-risk individuals. Evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score are used to assess model accuracy and effectiveness. The project also integrates visualization tools to illustrate trends and highlight significant predictors.

This project is designed for scalability, allowing further refinement through feature engineering and model tuning. It can be expanded with additional data sources, such as social media sentiment analysis or clinical records, to improve predictive capabilities. The goal is to create an AI-assisted tool that can aid professionals in recognizing early warning signs and implementing timely interventions.

To use the project, users can clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the provided Jupyter Notebook. The workflow includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Contributions from researchers and developers are encouraged to enhance model performance and expand its applicability.

This project is open-source under the MIT License, making it accessible for further development and integration. If you are interested in collaborating or have questions, feel free to reach out. We hope this initiative contributes to the ongoing efforts in mental health support and suicide prevention.
